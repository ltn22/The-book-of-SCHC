In this chapter, in addition to compressing a ping6 request we will fragment it.
For that, we will create a ping6 request that exceeds the maximum L2 MTU allowed for the device:

\end{lstlisting}

As one may notice, in this case the size of the \texttt{data} field of the ICMPv6 Echo Request is expanded in order to make the total package size larger. 
In this way, when the query arrives at the core it has to be first compressed and then fragmented so that it conforms to the MTU accepted by the device.

~

The following fragmentation rules are then added to the SoR and can be applied to that traffic:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Fragmentation Rules in rule icmp2.json}, backgroundcolor=\color{yellow}, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small, label=rule-icmp2]
	 },{
		"RuleID" : 12,
		"RuleIDLength" : 11,
		"Fragmentation" : {
			"FRMode": "NoAck",
			"FRDirection": "DW"
	 }
	 },{	
		"RuleID" : 13,
		"RuleIDLength" : 11,
		"Fragmentation" : {
		"FRMode": "NoAck",
		"FRDirection": "UP"
		} 
    }
]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Understanding fragmentation rules}

In addition to the rule ID, the rule ID length a fragmentation rule contains two  parameters: the mode and the direction.

~

In order to support reliability, variable L2 MTUs and unidirectional links, the RFC 8724 defines three different fragmentation modes: (i) No-Ack, designed for limited and variable MTU sizes under the assumption that there is no out-of-sequence delivery, (ii) Ack-on-Error for variable MTU and out-of-order delivery using sporadic ACK messages and (iii) Ack-allways for invariable MTUs and no out-of-sequence delivery.
In the following we will go deeper into details of these three modes.

~

As for the direction, it is necessary to stay the behaviour of the SCHC action based on where the traffic is originated.
In our example, we will use the rule \texttt{12/11} for fragmentation on Downlink and rule \texttt{13/11} for fragmentation on Uplink.
Therefore, if the traffic goes from the core to the device (Downlink), we use rule \texttt{12/11} for fragmenting the traffic at the core side and reassembling at the device side.
On the contrary, rule \texttt{13/11} is used for fragmenting the traffic going from the device to the co and for the reassembly processes at the core side.

~

As stated in RFC 8724, in OpenSCHC, SCHC Fragmentation is always done after compression\footnote{It shall rather be noted that, the no-compression rule is also permitted. Therefore, if one is willing to use only SCHC Fragmentation, two rules should be defined: (i) no-compression rule and (ii) the desired fragmentation rule.}. 
Then, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:icmpv6_query} the whole process goes as following:

\caption{ICMPv6 Query Reception when MTU exceeds L2 MTU: (a) Receiver behaviour, (b) Transmitter behaviour.}    \label{fig-icmpv6_query}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ICMPv6 Echo Request Query Reception at core (Figure.\ref{fig-icmpv6_query}(a))
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An user send a ICMPv6 Echo request exceeding the maximum MTU allowed.
    \item The request arrives at the core side. It verifies if there is a compression rule on its SoR applicable to this specific traffic.
    \item If it exists, the core applies the compression rule. 
    Then, it verifies if the resulting packet surpasses the L2 MTU size.
    \item If yes, the core verifies if there is a fragmentation rule on dowlink.
    \item If there is one, the core applies the fragmentation using the mode defined in the rule.
    \item The core starts to send fragments to the device.
    \end{enumerate}

\item ICMPv6 Echo Request Query Reception at device (Figure.\ref{fig:icmpv6_query}(b)) : 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The device receives SCHC packets containing the fragments.
    \item The device verifies if there is a fragmentation rule and start the reassembly process.
    \item Once the reassembly process is finished, the device search for a compression ruls applicable to this specific traffic.
    \item The device applies the compression rule to decompress the packet.
    \item The device retrieves the ICMPv6 Echo Reply Query.
    \item At the application level, the device creates a ICMPv6 Echo Reply.
\end{enumerate}

\item ICMPv6 Echo Reply Query Transmission at device (Figure.\ref{fig:icmpv6_query}(a)) : 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The device verifies if there is a Compression rule for the ICMPv6 Echo Reply.
    \item If yes, the device compress the packet.
    \item The device verifies if the resulting packet surpasses the L2 MTU size.
    \item If yes, it looks for a Fragmentation rule in its SoR applicable to this traffic.
    \item If there is one, the device applies the fragmentation using the mode as defined in the rule.
    \item The device start to send fragments to the device.
\end{enumerate}

\item ICMPv6 Echo Reply Query Reception at core (Figure.\ref{fig:icmpv6_query}(b)) : 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The core receives SCHC packets containing the fragments.
    \item The core verifies if there is fragmentation rule in its SoR, if yes, it starts the reassembly process.
    \item Once finished, the core search for compression rules applicable to this specific traffic 
    \item If there is a compression rue, it decompress the packet.
    \item The core forwards the ICMPv6 Echo Reply to the user.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Fragmentation in No-ACK mode}

This fragmentation mode is designed for no out-of sequence delivery and admits variable L2 MTU.
In No-ACK mode, there is no communication from the fragment receiver to the fragment sender.  
The sender transmits all the SCHC Fragments without expecting any acknowledgement.  
Therefore, there is no need for bidirectional links.

\subsection{SCHC Fragments Format}

In No-ACK, there are two kinds of SCHC Fragments: (i) \texttt{All-0} fragments presented in Figure.\ref{fig:all-0}, and the last fragment called \texttt{All-1} depicted in Figure.\ref{fig:all-1}
An all-0 fragment, is composed of the following fields\footnote{The RFC 8724 also defines the \texttt{DTag} (Datagram Tag) and the \texttt{W} (Window) fields. The former is used for differentiating SCHC F/R messages belonging to different SCHC Packets, for our example this field is not present, and the latter, representing the Window size used in Ack-on-Error and Ack-Allways modes}:

~

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{RuleID}
    %\item W:
    \item \texttt{FCN}: It is used to differentiate All-0 and All-1 fragments. 
    \item \texttt{Fragment Payload}: Corresponds to the payload. Its size is aligned to the remaining space from to fit the L2 MTU.
\end{itemize}

~

\begin{figure}[!ht] 
    \centering 
    \input{figs/all-0-NoAck}
    \caption{All-0 SCHC Fragment in No-Ack mode} 
    \label{fig-all-0} 
\end{figure} 

The second type of fragment is the \texttt{All-1}, it corresponds to the last fragment. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:all-1}, contrary to the \texttt{All-0}, it also contains the RCS field, and it can also contains padding as needed in order to fit the L2 word size.

\begin{figure}[!ht] 
    \centering 
    \input{figs/all-1-NoAck}
    \caption{All-1 SCHC Fragment in No-Ack mode} 
    \label{fig-all-1} 
\end{figure} 
   
In OpenSCHC the Reassembly Check Sequence (RCS) field corresponds to the result of using the CRC32 algorithm, and as recommended by the RFC 8724 it is computed on the full SCHC packet (after reassembly) concatenated with the padding bits.

\subsection{Fragmentation/Reassembly Process}

In this mode, since there are no fragment acknowledgments, the sender creates as many fragments as needed based on the size of the compressed SCHC packet and the L2 MTU.
Figure \ref{fig:NoAck} presents an example where $n$ fragments are needed. 
In this case, the transmitter creates $n-1$ \texttt{All-0} fragments and one \texttt{All-1} with the corresponding RCS field and padding if needed.

\begin{figure}[!ht] 
    \centering 
    \input{figs/NoAck}
    \caption{All-1 SCHC Fragment in No-Ack mode} 
    \label{fig-NoAck} 
\end{figure} 

\subsection{The code}

In this section, we will present the code necessary to process an icmpv6 echo request that exceeds the L2 MTU size. 
Two blocks of code are required: core and device programs. 
For the downlink, they are in charge of: 

\begin{itemize}
\item core program: receiving the IPv6 packet, compressing it, fragmenting it and sending the SCHC fragments.
\item device program: reassembling and decompressing SCHC packets and, creating the echo reply packet.
\end{itemize} 

For the uplink, they are in charge of: 

\begin{itemize}
\item device program: compressing and fragmenting the IPv6 Echo Reply packet, and sending the SCHC fragments to the core.
\item core program: reassembling and decompressing SCHC packets and, forwarding the Echo reply IPv6 Packet to the user.
\end{itemize} 


\subsubsection{Core program}

For this example we will extend the code used in Section~\ref{sec:compr_code}. 
As in the previous case the Compression and Fragmentation process starts with the creation of a Rule Manager \texttt{rm} used to add the rules from the file \texttt{icmp2.json} (cf. \vref{rule-icmp2}), which includes the Rule 3 for compressing and Rules 12 and 13 for fragmenting.

~

As presented in Listing~\vref{prog-ping-core2}, the process follows the same logic as in the compression example. 
The \texttt{processPkt} function filters SCHC packets coming from devices and IPv6 tunneled packets from Hurricane Electric. 

~

As in the C/D only example, the \texttt{processPkt} calls the SCHC Machine and then looks at the received packets. 
There can be two kinds off packets: (i) IPv6 tunneled packets filtered by looking at the IP proto 41 and passed to the SCHC Machine removing the first 34 bytes (Ethernet and IPv4 headers), and (ii) SCHC Packets filtered by looking at the UDP socket port \texttt{0x5C4C}.
